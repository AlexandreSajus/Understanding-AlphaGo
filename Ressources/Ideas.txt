David Silver
Lead Researcher, DeepMind
"The game of Go is the holy grail of artificial intelligence. For many years, people have looked at this 
game and thought "Wow, this is just to hard!". Everything we've tried in AI, it just falls over when you 
try the game of Go. [...] If we can crack Go, 
we know we've done something special."
